Here you find the examples given in the course

doc -> possible additional documentation

lib -> possible general libraries needed to compile some example

include -> General include files

src -> Directory with example sources

All examples are provided with a Makefile which accepts the following
options (some Makefile may have additional options, reported in the
README file specific for the example)

all -makes the example

clean -as it says

distclean -clean and also deletes temporary file and local doc directory

doc -creates directory doc and fills it with the documentation of the
example produced by doxygen. The file DoxiFileCommon contains the common 
doxygen configuration for all examples

All makefiles include the file Makefile.inc in this directory and
possibly the Makefile.inc file local to the example under consideration. You should modify those files to suit your need.

In particular, the user may modify the Makefile.inc to change some compilation
option. The main Makefile.inc also sets the PACS_ROOT variable, which
should indicate this directory (with full path). You may change it to suite
your local installation by editing the file or by setting an environmental
variable with the same name.

Being all the first target of the makefile, to compile the examples is
sufficient to type make. with make doc you compile the documentation.

                *****   IMPORTANT  ****
To install some utilities used by different examples you must go to src/Utilities and do
make
make install

in this way a linrary called libpacs is installed in lib and some files are installed in include
