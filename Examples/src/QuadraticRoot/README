This is an example of floating point error accumulation due to
cancellation. Using the common formula for the root of a quadratic
polynomial, expecially is using float (8 bytys precision) for floating
point type.

Typing make will produce two executables main_float and main_double,
the first uses floats to store variables.

Note the use of -D option to change the type in the program using a c
preprocessor macro.
