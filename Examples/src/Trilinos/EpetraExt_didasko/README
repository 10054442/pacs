This files have been taken from the packages/didasko/example/epetra
directory of the trilinos Ver. 10.10. They should work also with later
versions of trilinos.

I have remade the Makefile to be able to compile the code if one has
trilinos installed. Set the correct trilinos path in the main Makefile.inc file.

Check is the trilinos libraries have the form libXXX.so of
libtrilinos_XXX.so, end set in the Makefile.inc the variable
TILINOS_PREFIX accordingly.

You may chancge CXX to mpic++ and remember to use mpirun to run the executables!

If yor trilinos installation is not standard remember to set up the
environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
