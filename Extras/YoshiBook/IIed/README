Version of the code contined in the book by Mark Joshi on C++ and
design pattern applied to mathematical finance. 

The modifications have been carried out be Luca Formaggia, Politecnico
di Milano and consist fo

1) Creation of Makefiles for the compilation of the files in the
source directory and the creation of a static and dynamic libdary (in
the lib directory).  Another Makefile is present in the mains
directory to compile the main programs provided (you have to create
the library first!)

2) The code is mainly for illustration and teaching purposes, so some
header files are though as alternatives (PayOff.h and PayOff2.h, for
instance) since they declare the same methods. The problems is that in
the corresponding cpp files in the original version introduced name
clashes when creating the library. The solution was found by
introducing namespaces. The usability of the code is unchanged,
however, since the header files interested in this modification
eventually introduce a namespace directive to bring the names to the
current namespace. Therefore, incompatible headers file in the
original version remains incompatible. The only advantage is that now
we can create the library.

3) Some errors were present for Unix systems, where the names of files
are case sensitive. This has been corrected.

4) The fabs function is now declared in the std namespace, where it belongs. 

5) Header guards have been introduced throughout.
