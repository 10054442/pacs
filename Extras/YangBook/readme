C++ and Object-Oriented Numeric Computing for Scientists and Engineers
Daoqi Yang, Springer, New York, 2001. ISBN:0-387-98990-0

The code that I have used in each chapter are in the 
subdirectories. For example, subdirectory
                chapter11 
contains the matrix algebra code in Chapter 11 of the book.

The programs may not have been neatly written. The purpose that they
are here for free downloading is only to save your typing and time. 
However, some code has been slightly changed to comform to the 
new and ANSI/ISO compiler GNU g++ compiler (gcc 3.0, release June 2001). 
The non-template code in the chapters are also compiled by SUN CC 
(C++ 5.1, release April 2001) compiler, which does not compile some 
templates correctly.

By the way, some of the code may not compile if you are using a
compiler that is different from mine. So modify them if necessary.

If you find any error in the code, please let me know (Daoqi yang,
yang@na-net.ornl.gov, daoqi_yang@yahoo.com, yang@math.wayne.edu). 
I will then modify the code, which may be benefical to other readers.

Thanks,
Daoqi Yang
