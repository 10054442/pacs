Luca Formaggia August 2005

The code is slightly modified version of the code available with the book

C++ and Object-Oriented Numeric Computing for Scientists and Engineers
Daoqi Yang, Springer, New York, 2001. ISBN:0-387-98990-0, see the
readme file for details.


Some modifications have been made to have a consistent makefile and a
better compliance with the C++98 standard (gcc>3.4 now compiles).

The code is compliant with C++98 syntax. No C++11.

Some compiler warning are in fact related to the example.
