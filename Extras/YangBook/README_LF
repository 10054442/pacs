Luca Formaggia August 2005/Octobre 2012

The code is slightly modified version of the code available with the book

C++ and Object-Oriented Numeric Computing for Scientists and Engineers
Daoqi Yang, Springer, New York, 2001. ISBN:0-387-98990-0, see the
readme file for details.


Some modifications have been made to have a consistent makefile and a
better compliance with the C++98 standard (gcc>3.4 now compiles).

The code is compliant with C++98 syntax. No C++11.

The modifications I have made are minimal:

> all standard header files now do not have the extension .h 

> Massive use of using namespace std (sorry). Standard compliant
> compilers REQUIRE the full qualified name for standard library names

> exit() is in <cstdlib>. Added the include. Older compiler put exit()
> in the global workspace, but this is not C++98 compilant

> some char * have been changed to char const * to avoid warnings. Indeed
  
   void foo(char * c){...};
   ....
   foo("A message");

>is tolerated by some compiler, but not correct, since a literal
>string is not a lvalue and cannot be changed. Thus, initialising 
>char*c to a constant string generates (at least) a warning from the
>compiler.


Note: some other compiler warnings are in fact related to the material 
the example wants to illustrate.
