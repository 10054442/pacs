Write a different program for each of the following point.
\begin{itemize}

    \item Statically check if a template parameter of a class is \cpp{int} or
    \cpp{double}; rise an error otherwise.

    \item Declare a function that print a template variable. Statically check
    if the latter is not a raw pointer.

    \item Declare \cpp{unsigned int i}, then declear a \cpp{float} or an \cpp{int}
    if \cpp{i} is signed or unsigned without explicity know the type of \cpp{i}.
    Check the result.

\end{itemize}

Write a program that perform a dot product using the template metaprogramming
technique. Using the following hints:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Use the container \cpp{std::array} to store the two vectors.

    \item Declare a class templetized on the index, using a
    \cpp{std::size_t}, of the array.

    \item In the class introduce a static method, called \cpp{apply}, which
    perform one operation of the dot product and call again \cpp{apply} with the
    index decreased by one. Beware, this method should be \cpp{inline}.

    \item Specialize the method \cpp{apply} for the case of zero index.

    \item Overload the \cpp{operator *} and use it.

\end{enumerate}
