We would like to intragrate in the program \texttt{AllDynamic} the possibility
to handle also the integrands with a factory. In particular we would like to
collect some dynamic libraries with different integrands, using both classes
functor and free functions. The number of the libraries is unknown and their
loading still have to be dynamic. The chosen of the integrand is done in the
data file, handled by GetPot, using the key associated in the registration
process.  Each library has to be independent from the others one and has to
resister autonomously their products. In this way the adding of a new library is
just a modification in the data file, the main program has not to be recompiled.

Modifications on the class \cpp{class Factory} are not allowed.
In the sequel there are present some useful points that might be followed.
Beware that each modification of the code might also affect the \texttt{Makefile}.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Do not use the class \cpp{class udfHandler}, using the new factory
    instead.

    \item Using the function wrapper \cpp{std::function}, of the standard
    library, to uniformly register the integrands into the factory.

    \item Create a new proxy class for the registration of the integrands.
    Discuss why it is useful to split the builder function from the class proxy.

    \item Remove the \cpp{extern "C"} from the header files containing the free
    functions. Create a new file, or use the corresponding source file,
    for the registration using the proxy previously introduced.

    \item Introduce also a class functor, in a separate library, and use it.

\end{enumerate}

To increase the robustness of using the quadrature rules with the factory,
statically check if the template parameter \cpp{ConcreteProduct} inherits
from \cpp{AbstractProduct_type}, defined into the factory. Furthermore the
static member \cpp{Build} has to be converted in the corresponding type defined
into the factory. Use the \cpp{std::traits} and the \cpp{static_assert} for this
purpose. Statically checked means that these features have to be checked at
compile time.

The structure of the folder \texttt{exercice} is the following.
\begin{verbatim}
.
`-- src
    |-- QuadratureRule
    |   |-- AllDynamic
    |   |-- baseVersion
    |   `-- generic_factory
    `-- Utilities
        `-- include
\end{verbatim}
