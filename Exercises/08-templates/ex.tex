\section*{Exercise}

Starting from the solution of a previous exercise session on iterative methods
to compute a zero of a function.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Implement a template functor that manages the function and optionally
  the derivative of the function to be used by the method. Analyze all the
  possible implementation strategy with their advantages and drawbacks. Take
  care in converting also the \cpp{apply} method to a template one.

  \item Add a template parameter to the whole class hierarchy. The template is
  introduced to allow the use of a function or a functor. Also in this case the
  implementation details can vary, with advantages and drawbacks.

  \item Substitute the dynamic polymorphism paradigm with a static polymorphism
  paradigm.

\end{enumerate}
