\subsection*{Exercise 1}

Build the connection matrix $B\in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 5}$ relative to the web
made of the 5 pages, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:web}.

link}

using the \texttt{Eigen} library, write down a class that computes the maximum
eigenvalue (that is 1) and the corresponding eigenvector, that is the
\emph{pagerank}. Implement also \cpp{operator<<} to see the data inside the
class on the screen.
